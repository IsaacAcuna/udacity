# "Jogger" - Classic Arcade Game. 

This is a classic arcade game made with Javascript for my udacity microdegree program. Run past the joggers and get to the water to win. Each time you make it to the water the joggers run faster. 

## Getting Started

Install the files in the arcade-game folder into any directory that is being served by a web server and load the index.html page via a browser. 

### Pre-requisites

Any reasonably modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
