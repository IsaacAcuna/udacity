# "Grocery List Mania" - Memory Card Game.

This is a memory card game for my udacity microdegree program. Match all of the card pairs as quickly as possible - with the least amount of card flips to win the highest score. 

Each card pair has it's own individual points and time reduction/addition properties:

## Card Pairs

* Jar of Questionable Expiration - point value: 250 - timer effect: add 30 seconds to the timer.
* Orange of Enlightenment - point value: 250 - timer effect: remove 30 seconds from the timer.
* Pear of Unending Woe - point value: 175 - timer effect: add 25 seconds to the timer.
* Honeycomb of Fortified Resolve - point value: 175 - timer effect: remove 25 seconds from the timer.
* Steak of Gluttony - point value: 125 - timer effect: add 10 seconds to the timer.
* Oven Mitt of Smiting - point value: 125 - timer effect: remove 10 seconds from the timer. 
* Mushrooms of Nostalgia - point value: 100 - timer effect: add 5 seconds to the timer.
* Donut of Partial Integrity - point value: 100 - timer effect: remove 5 seconds from the timer.

The final score is calculated by the ratio of flipped cards to matched pairs and the amount of time it takes to complete the game. 

## Getting Started
